00:00:00.213 --> 00:00:02.253
Suppose you have a series of numbers or

00:00:02.253 --> 00:00:04.173
dates that you need to enter consecutively

00:00:05.813 --> 00:00:08.133
In this case, let's create a new column

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:08.773
for the year

00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:12.481
Type the starting value in a cell equals

00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:13.841
year F2

00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:20.846
Hover your cursor over the small square

00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:22.806
at the bottom right corner of the cell

00:00:22.846 --> 00:00:24.566
until it turns into a black cross

00:00:25.214 --> 00:00:27.654
Click and drag the cross down or across

00:00:27.654 --> 00:00:29.694
and Excel will automatically fill in the

00:00:29.694 --> 00:00:30.454
series for you

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.180
You can also do that by double clicking

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.580
the cell

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.260
As you can see, no need to manually enter

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.740
each value, Excel does the work for you
