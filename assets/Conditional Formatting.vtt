00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.390
First, let's start with selecting the

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:03.910
data you want to apply conditional

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:04.630
formatting to

00:00:05.118 --> 00:00:07.078
Let's select column B for example

00:00:07.518 --> 00:00:09.198
Click on Conditional Formatting on the

00:00:09.198 --> 00:00:09.758
Home tab

00:00:10.855 --> 00:00:13.055
Now let's define the criteria that will

00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:15.335
trigger your formatting rules. You can

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:16.975
choose from rules like highlighting

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:19.135
values greater than a certain number or

00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:20.695
containing specific text

00:00:21.175 --> 00:00:23.415
Let's select 'text that contains'

00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:27.131
In the dialog box section, define your

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:29.691
criteria. For instance, if you want to

00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:31.451
highlight cells containing the word '

00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:34.411
High', enter 'High' in the text box and

00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:37.131
select 'with red fill with dark red text'

00:00:38.483 --> 00:00:40.503
You can do the same process for the words'

00:00:40.503 --> 00:00:43.243
;medium' and 'low' and choose the

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:45.003
colors you wish to format them in

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.010
You should see all the cells containing

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.210
the word 'High' are now highlighted the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.530
way you chose and so on, enabling an

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.450
instant visual prioritization of

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.210
important data

00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:01.994
This rule also will automatically adjust

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:04.354
the format of any new entries matching

00:01:04.354 --> 00:01:05.634
the specified keywords
