00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.750
To start, add a new sheet to the excel

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.830
file at the bottom. Double click it to

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.590
name it 'Structured Table'.

00:00:08.593 --> 00:00:11.033
Select the data in column A by clicking

00:00:11.033 --> 00:00:13.633
and dragging your cursor over it from row

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:16.353
one to seven, right click and selectcopy.

00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:19.884
Go to your new sheet and right click in

00:00:19.884 --> 00:00:22.644
cell A1. Under the Paste options select

00:00:22.644 --> 00:00:25.444
Transpose. The data stored in rows is now

00:00:25.444 --> 00:00:27.324
copied across multiple columns.

00:00:43.237 --> 00:00:45.997
Now select all the data, copy and paste

00:00:45.997 --> 00:00:48.837
into the new sheet in cell A2, again

00:00:48.837 --> 00:00:50.877
using the Transpose paste option.

00:00:53.673 --> 00:00:55.873
Now your data is correctly formatted into

00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:58.273
rows and columns. You just need to change

00:00:58.273 --> 00:01:01.233
the value in A1 from 'data' to 'year'  so

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:02.993
the column is correctly labeled.

00:01:03.457 --> 00:01:06.217
Finally, select all your data and format

00:01:06.217 --> 00:01:08.337
it into a table using one of the methods

00:01:08.337 --> 00:01:10.137
you learned in the previous exercise.
