00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.990
Let's say you want to calculate the total

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.030
amount of sightings for this type of frog

00:00:05.517 --> 00:00:07.997
Begin your formula with an equal sign and

00:00:07.997 --> 00:00:09.037
type the function name

00:00:10.716 --> 00:00:12.396
The function we want to be using is sum f

00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:14.636
or addition.  Start with equal sum,

00:00:15.084 --> 00:00:17.044
then select the cells or type their

00:00:17.044 --> 00:00:20.004
references inside the parentheses. Finish

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:21.524
by closing the parentheses.

00:00:22.345 --> 00:00:24.785
Once your formula is complete, press

00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:26.545
enter and here you go

00:00:27.888 --> 00:00:29.608
Let's now look as a more complicated

00:00:29.608 --> 00:00:31.816
formulaIf you want to count the number of

00:00:31.816 --> 00:00:33.696
occurrences this frog species was

00:00:33.696 --> 00:00:35.976
recorded at a high confidence level, you

00:00:35.976 --> 00:00:37.416
can use the Count IF function.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.280
Click on the cell where you want the

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.160
result to appear

00:00:40.584 --> 00:00:42.344
Type in Equals COUNTIF to start your

00:00:42.344 --> 00:00:42.824
formula

00:00:43.784 --> 00:00:45.664
Then select the range that contains the

00:00:45.664 --> 00:00:47.344
species names, column A

00:00:48.048 --> 00:00:50.448
Type a comma and then in quotation marks

00:00:50.448 --> 00:00:52.488
specify the species name you are

00:00:52.488 --> 00:00:53.208
interested in

00:00:53.592 --> 00:00:56.352
As you can see, Excel will provide a hint

00:00:56.352 --> 00:00:58.632
beneath the formula, guiding you through

00:00:58.632 --> 00:00:59.992
the correct writing format

00:01:00.504 --> 00:01:03.144
To continue, type another comma to add the

00:01:03.144 --> 00:01:05.544
2nd criteria range, which would be the

00:01:05.544 --> 00:01:07.264
confidence level column B in the

00:01:07.264 --> 00:01:07.904
spreadsheet

00:01:08.328 --> 00:01:10.808
Type the final comma and in quotation

00:01:10.808 --> 00:01:13.608
marks put the desired confidence level '

00:01:13.608 --> 00:01:14.008
high'

00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:16.671
Drag the corner of the cell downward to

00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:18.911
replicate the formula. Then adjust the

00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:21.111
confidence level within the quotes to '

00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:23.831
Medium' or 'Low' to

00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:25.311
obtain respective counts
